					<h2>Bibliography</h2>
					<p>My name is Simon Rahnasto and I love programming. My first encounter with it was back in 2010, when I started learning Blizzards 'GalaxyScript' in order to create custom maps for the popular RTS title 'SC2'.
						With it I created a custom game named 'The Final Stand', which at it's peak reached the second most played custom map in the European Region (and 7th in the US). Ever since then I have been hooked to programming
						and I really enjoy learning new languages, paradigms, patterns, algorithms and datastructures. I am currently a student at Stockholm University in my final Semester. In my free time I enjoy creating Programming tutorials,
						working in personal projects and playing RTS games.

					<h2>Youtube Channel</h2>
					<p>I started a Youtube channel in august 2020, which helps people get started with programming.
						The channel currently has a focus on 2d game development with the Lua programming language and the open source framework 'LÃ¶ve'.
